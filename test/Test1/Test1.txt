CS 329E (Mitra)           Test 1              5 Oct 2016

A new French restaurant called Bon Appetit has opened in your
neighborhood. It is an upscale restaurant that serves ridiculously
small portions at extravagantly high prices. They have asked you
to create a web page for them.

The web page must be colorful and lush. You must have a HTML
page called test1.html and a CSS page called test1.css. All of
the structural information and text will be in the .html file
and all the design and layout information in the .css file. 

You must have at least a two column layout with header and footer. 
You will have the following links: menus, wine list, reservations, 
reviews, and about us. The links - menus, wine list, reviews, and 
about us should point to an empty HTML page that includes a redirect
link back to the restaurant's home page.

Only the reservations link will be a working link. It will link
to a page that has a form. This form will be simple but elegant
having fields - name, phone number, number of guests, date, and
time. You must use the HTML5 Date Time picker. There should also 
be a submit and reset button. The action attribute for the form 
should be blank.

For the home page of this restaurant you must use at least five
of the images that we have given you. You must use an additional
three images that you have either downloaded from the internet 
or three additional images from the ones that we have given you.
In all you will have eight images.

You will have to write the text that goes with the homepage. You
want the text to be short and simple. The text and the design have
to be professional and befitting of an upscale restaurant. All 
the test must be brief but relevant. There must not be spelling 
or grammatical errors in your text.

You have two hours to complete the project. We will give you
an extra hour without penalty. You may take more than three
hours to complete. But after three hours there is a penalty
of 10 points for every half hour (or part of a half hour) late.

During the exam period, you may use any printed material, you may
browse the internet and look at actual sites of upscale restaurants. 
But you cannot consult any one on this project. You may not talk or 
excahnge information about the test with any of your classmates 
or with any other person in the world or get help from someone
else. It has to be solely your own work! 

We suggest that you do all your development work on your local 
machine. If you did your development work on the z server, make 
sure after you have have finished that you make all your files 
connected with this test unreadable by changing the permission
to 600. It is your responsibility to protect your work.  

After you have finished, we want you to zip the .html and .css 
files and all the image files that you have used. Call the zip
file your_uteid_test1.zip. Upload that zipped file to Canvas.
Do not make changes to your files after the submission deadline.
